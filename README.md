# mcfunction-jukebox

McFunction Jukebox (MCFJ) is a small application that can be used to convert
.MID music into .mcfunction files that you can add to your datapack.

The resulting functions should be run every tick from your datapack.
Tags are used to keep track of which players should be hearing the music.
